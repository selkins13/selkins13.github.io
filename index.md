I am a proud mother of 2 children and have been married for over 17 years to a wonderful husband.

Originally from the lakes area of Kentucky, I love to travel and see other parts for the country and world.  We usually will spend some time fishing anywhere we go, as this is one of our favorite hobbies.  I also love to read and watch movies.  

I was late in moving into the Technology field, but have found a love and passion for my work.
