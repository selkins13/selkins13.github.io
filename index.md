I am a proud mother of 2 children and have been married for over 17 years to a wonderful husband. My family and I currently reside in Georgetown, Texas.  We love the proximity to Austin, multiple lakes to fish and the weather.

Originally from the lakes area of Kentucky, I love to travel and see other parts for the country and world.  We usually will spend some time fishing anywhere we go, as this is one of our favorite hobbies.  I also love to read.  Some of my favorites are the Harry Potter books.  My family and I are Potter-Heads!!

I have worked for Hewlett Packard Enterprise for over 3 years as a Product Development Engineer.  In this role, I have been responsible for the design and implementation of third party Source Code Management (SCM) tools used by the company’s internal developers.  These tools have included Team Foundation Server (on-premise), GitHub Enterprise and CollabNet TeamForge (Subversion/Gerrit).  I have also been an avid user of the many Build/Deploy, DevOps and Quality Management tools that are also hosted by my team, including Jenkins, FlowDock, Hubots and Docker.  

I am also an internal advocate for DevOps practices and Social Coding.   In this role, I have presented and shared best practices and my experiences to other developers and business groups within the company.  I enjoy showing our developers how DevOps can make their jobs easier by using automation, pipelines, APIs and ChatOps to complete repetitive tasks.  I enjoy showing someone how something as simple as creating a Pull Request in GitHub Enterprise or sending a message to a Hubot in a ChatOps tool can start a chain of automate events making their jobs easier.  I also like to stress to our developers that if a job can be automated, there is less of a chance of “Human Error” being introduced.    

On another note, I would like to give you a little more about my background as it demonstrates more of my non-technical skills.  For six years prior to starting my career at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I worked as a Telecommunications Operator, which to most people is an Emergency 911 Operator.  While in this position, I was responsible for taking emergency calls, gathering information from the callers, passing that information on to the appropriate agency/agencies (Police, Fire, Rescue, EMS, etc.), and giving the caller instructions over the phone.  All of my actions could have been the difference in life or death for not only the callers, but also the emergency responders.  This was, by no means, an easy job.  It takes patience, the ability to calm others (even if you are not), and the ability to multi-task.  Many times, I would be listening to a caller, giving instructions to emergency responders and typing notes in the recording system all at the same time.  As you can imagine, it was a stressful job.  However, I enjoyed every minute of it and found it to be very rewarding.  The last nine months at my last Telecommunications position, I was also the Supervisor and was charged with creating the training materials and program for future Telecommunications Operators.  

My goal is to continue to grow my skills and abilities in the DevOps areas.  I know that this is an everchanging world and I want to continue to be an advocate helping other developers to simplify their world.  As I have eluded above, I enjoy helping people and do not ever see that as changing.
