## 📚 About Me

I’m a developer advocate, engagement leader, and lifelong learner with a passion for helping others succeed in technology. 
Outside of work, I’m also a proud mother, wife, and grandmother. My husband and I enjoy a semi-nomadic lifestyle as full-time RVers, 
traveling across the U.S. and making the most of the journey. I love reading (yes, I’m a Potter-Head 📚✨), fishing, and exploring new places 
with my family.

## 🚀 AI Advocacy

I actively **use and advocate for <span class="ai-highlight">AI tools</span>** to help developers and teams work smarter. By integrating assistants like <span class="ai-highlight">GitHub Copilot</span> and other <span class="ai-highlight">AI-powered solutions</span> into workshops, documentation, and enablement, I demonstrate how <span class="ai-highlight">AI</span> can accelerate repetitive tasks, reduce context-switching, and inspire new ideas.

My focus is on **responsible <span class="ai-highlight">AI</span> adoption**—showing where <span class="ai-highlight">AI</span> can amplify productivity while making clear where human judgment, creativity, and collaboration remain essential. I coach both customers and colleagues on how to embrace <span class="ai-highlight">AI</span> safely and effectively, making it a natural part of their toolchain and day-to-day workflows.


## 🧰 My Work at GitHub

I combine **technical expertise** with a passion for **teaching, mentoring, and advocacy**. I build hands‑on workshops and clear documentation that help developers see GitHub as more than a source repo—it’s a **productivity engine**.

Internally, I’ve contributed **onboarding** materials for Engagement Managers and Project Managers and I actively **mentor** new team members. My goal is to multiply impact—turning knowledge into repeatable practices, and turning first‑time tasks into reliable playbooks that others can adopt. I also champion **responsible <span class="ai-highlight">AI</span> adoption**, helping colleagues and customers experiment safely and effectively.

## ✨ My Previous Work

Before joining GitHub, I spent over five years at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where I helped global teams modernize their development practices. I engineered and integrated source code management solutions (GitHub Enterprise, TeamForge, TFS) and built CI/CD pipelines that powered enterprise applications. Alongside the tech, I championed DevOps and social coding, teaching developers how automation and ChatOps reduce errors and accelerate delivery.

I also contributed to the developer community by organizing HPE CodeWars, a coding competition inspiring high school students to pursue technology careers.

In 2019, I joined KPMG as a Technology Advisor, where I delivered presentations and training on Agile/DevOps practices and created technical documentation and assessments that guided large-scale transformation projects. I also provided cross-functional coaching, helping developers, administrators, and process owners adopt new workflows with confidence.

Before I began my career in Tech, I worked as a 911 Telecommunications Operator and Supervisor, where I managed high-stakes emergency calls and trained new operators. This experience sharpened my ability to stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly, and design training that prepares people for critical situations.

## 🚀 Future Work

building stronger communities, and amplifying developer feedback to shape better products. My goal is to use my blend of technical expertise, 
storytelling skills, and advocacy experience to inspire and enable developers worldwide.

## 🤝 Developer Advocacy & Mentorship

I’m passionate about **advocating for developers**—helping them understand not just how to use tools, but how to unlock their full potential through them. Whether I’m guiding customers in adopting GitHub best practices, or coaching teammates through complex engagements, I focus on enabling others to be more effective and confident.

Beyond the technical side, I love **mentoring new colleagues**, building **onboarding resources**, and ensuring no one has to start from scratch. Helping people connect the dots, shorten their learning curve, and feel successful is one of the most rewarding parts of my work.
