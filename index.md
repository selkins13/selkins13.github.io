## 📚 About Me

I’m a developer advocate, engagement leader, and lifelong learner with a passion for helping others succeed in technology. 
Outside of work, I’m also a proud mother, wife, and grandmother. My husband and I enjoy a semi-nomadic lifestyle as full-time RVers, 
traveling across the U.S. and making the most of the journey. I love reading (yes, I’m a Potter-Head 📚✨), fishing, and exploring new places 
with my family.

## 🧰 My Work at GitHub


For the past four years at GitHub, I’ve had the privilege of working at the intersection of **developer enablement, customer success, and community advocacy**.

As a **Senior Engagement Manager**, I recently led the creation of the **end-to-end Expert Services Engagement Lifecycle documentation (July 2025)**. This framework standardized the entire customer journey—from pre-delivery to post-delivery—ensuring consistency, scalability, and improved outcomes across all engagements.

Before that, as an **Engagement Manager**, I partnered closely with customers and internal teams to streamline onboarding, delivery, and customer success. I designed enablement materials and processes that empowered other Engagement Managers and Project Managers worldwide.

I began my GitHub career as an **Implementation Engineer**, where I worked with one of our largest government customers to design and implement their large-scale transformation from legacy tooling to GitHub. This work included:

- Creating the **GitHub Handbook** used by thousands of developers  
- Building onboarding pathways with documentation and assets  
- Hosting **workshops and webinars** for developers, program managers, and executives  
- Driving adoption of GitHub best practices in **DevOps, security, and open source collaboration**  

Throughout my time at GitHub, I’ve combined **technical expertise** with a passion for **teaching, community building, and storytelling**, helping customers and developers not just adopt GitHub—but thrive with it.

## ✨ My Previous Work

Before joining GitHub, I spent over five years at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where I helped global teams modernize their development practices. I engineered and integrated source code management solutions (GitHub Enterprise, TeamForge, TFS) and built CI/CD pipelines that powered enterprise applications. Alongside the tech, I championed DevOps and social coding, teaching developers how automation and ChatOps reduce errors and accelerate delivery.

I also contributed to the developer community by organizing HPE CodeWars, a coding competition inspiring high school students to pursue technology careers.

In 2019, I joined KPMG as a Technology Advisor, where I delivered presentations and training on Agile/DevOps practices and created technical documentation and assessments that guided large-scale transformation projects. I also provided cross-functional coaching, helping developers, administrators, and process owners adopt new workflows with confidence.

Before I began my career in Tech, I worked as a 911 Telecommunications Operator and Supervisor, where I managed high-stakes emergency calls and trained new operators. This experience sharpened my ability to stay calm under pressure, communicate clearly, and design training that prepares people for critical situations.

## 🚀 Future Work
