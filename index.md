I am a proud mother of 2 children and have been married for over 17 years to a wonderful husband. My family and I currently reside in Georgetown, Texas.  We love the proximity to Austin, multiple lakes to fish and the weather.

Originally from the lakes area of Kentucky, I love to travel and see other parts for the country and world.  We usually will spend some time fishing anywhere we go, as this is one of our favorite hobbies.  I also love to read.  Some of my favorites are the Harry Potter books.  My famliy and I are Potter-Heads!!
