## About Me

I‚Äôm a developer advocate, engagement leader, and lifelong learner with a passion for helping others succeed in technology. 
Outside of work, I‚Äôm also a proud mother, wife, and grandmother. My husband and I enjoy a semi-nomadic lifestyle as full-time RVers, 
traveling across the U.S. and making the most of the journey. I love reading (yes, I‚Äôm a Potter-Head üìö‚ú®), fishing, and exploring new places 
with my family.

## üß∞ My Work at GitHub


For the past four years at GitHub, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working at the intersection of **developer enablement, customer success, and community advocacy**.

As a **Senior Engagement Manager**, I recently led the creation of the **end-to-end Expert Services Engagement Lifecycle documentation (July 2025)**. This framework standardized the entire customer journey‚Äîfrom pre-delivery to post-delivery‚Äîensuring consistency, scalability, and improved outcomes across all engagements.

Before that, as an **Engagement Manager**, I partnered closely with customers and internal teams to streamline onboarding, delivery, and customer success. I designed enablement materials and processes that empowered other Engagement Managers and Project Managers worldwide.

I began my GitHub career as an **Implementation Engineer**, where I worked with one of our largest government customers to design and implement their large-scale transformation from legacy tooling to GitHub. This work included:

- Creating the **GitHub Handbook** used by thousands of developers  
- Building onboarding pathways with documentation and assets  
- Hosting **workshops and webinars** for developers, program managers, and executives  
- Driving adoption of GitHub best practices in **DevOps, security, and open source collaboration**  

Throughout my time at GitHub, I‚Äôve combined **technical expertise** with a passion for **teaching, community building, and storytelling**, helping customers and developers not just adopt GitHub‚Äîbut thrive with it.

## My Previous Work

I worked for Hewlett Packard Enterprise for over 5 years as a Source Code Management IT Engineer and Solutions Architect.  In this role, I was responsible for the design and implementation of third party Source Code Management (SCM) tools used by the company‚Äôs internal developers.  These tools included Team Foundation Server (on-premise), GitHub Enterprise and CollabNet TeamForge (Subversion/Gerrit).  I was also an avid user of the many Build/Deploy, DevOps and Quality Management tools that were also hosted by my team, including Jenkins, FlowDock, Hubot and Docker.

I was an internal advocate for DevOps practices and Social Coding.   In this role, I presented and shared best practices and my experiences to other developers and business groups within the company.  I enjoyed showing our developers how DevOps can make their jobs easier by using automation, pipelines, APIs and ChatOps to complete repetitive tasks.  I enjoyed showing someone how something as simple as creating a Pull Request in GitHub Enterprise or sending a message to a Hubot in a ChatOps tool would start a chain of automate events making their jobs easier.  I also liked to stress to our developers that if a job could be automated, there is less of a chance of ‚ÄúHuman Error‚Äù being introduced.

My background is not that of traditional IT.  For six years prior to starting my career at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I worked as a Telecommunications Operator, also know as an Emergency 911 Operator.  While in this position, I was responsible for taking emergency calls, gathering information from the callers, passing that information on to the appropriate agency/agencies (Police, Fire, Rescue, EMS, etc.), de-escalating situations and giving the caller instructions over the phone.  All of my actions could have been the difference in life or death for not only the callers, but also the emergency responders.  This was, by no means, an easy job.  It takes patience, the ability to calm others (even if you are not), and the ability to multi-task.  Many times, I would be listening to a caller, giving instructions to emergency responders and typing notes in the recording system all at the same time.  As you can imagine, it was a stressful job.  However, I enjoyed every minute of it and found it to be very rewarding.  The last nine months at my last Telecommunications position, I was also the Supervisor and was charged with creating the training materials and program for future Telecommunications Operators.

## My Future Work

I want to continue to grow my skills and watch the lightbulb light up for the people and teams that I interact with.  Organization and process definition is a passion of mine.  I am drawn to look at life from the perspective of how the outcome has been achieved and how could that be made better and have been doing this my whole life with EVERYTHING.  Finding inefficiencies in a process and working to resolve and streamline the process with as many low-touch steps as possible sometimes drives my husband crazy.  But, it is something I love to do and find relaxing.

I am also passionate about helping others.  I love to mentor and coach people to help them achieve their goals.  I have been told that I am a great teacher and that I can take complex topics and break them down into simple, easy to understand concepts.  I want to continue to do this in my career and help others achieve their goals, whether it is through training, mentoring, or just being a sounding board for ideas.
